# NEEX Legal Contract Review System

The NEEX Legal Contract Review System is an advanced, AI-powered tool designed to de-risk legal contracts by implementing the comprehensive NEEX blueprint methodology. It performs a deep, clause-by-clause analysis, identifies potential risks, and provides actionable negotiation recommendations to protect your interests.

This version has been architected for flexibility, supporting multiple leading AI providers: **Google Gemini**, **OpenAI**, and **OpenRouter.ai**.

## ‚ú® Core Features

This tool goes beyond simple contract summaries, providing a multi-layered analysis for legal professionals and business stakeholders.

-   **Multi-Provider AI Engine**: Seamlessly switch between Google Gemini, OpenAI, and OpenRouter.ai to leverage the best model for your needs.
-   **Deep Clause-by-Clause Analysis**: Each clause is broken down according to the NEEX blueprint's three critical layers:
    -   **Interpretation**: A neutral explanation of what the clause does.
    -   **Exposure**: An analysis of potential risks, liabilities, and vulnerabilities.
    -   **Opportunity**: Identification of negotiation hooks and points of leverage.
-   **Automated Risk Assessment**: Clauses are automatically scored with a risk level (**Critical**, **Material**, **Procedural**) and tagged with relevant risk categories (e.g., Financial, Legal, IPX).
-   **Actionable Negotiation Support**:
    -   **Negotiation Checklist**: A consolidated view of all AI-generated negotiation recommendations.
    -   **Suggested Redlines**: For high-risk clauses, the AI proposes improved, rewritten text to enhance clarity and defensibility.
-   **Modular Checklist Analysis**: The system audits the contract's structure against the NEEX blueprint, generating a report on potentially missing critical clauses (e.g., Indemnification, Limitation of Liability) and the risks of their absence.
-   **Flexible Document Handling**: Analyze contracts by pasting raw text or by uploading files (**PDF**, **DOCX**, **TXT**).
-   **Interactive & Resilient UI**:
    -   View analysis results in **real-time** as they are generated.
    -   **Stop** an analysis at any time without losing the progress already made.
-   **Exportable Reports**: Download the complete analysis report in **Markdown** for documentation or **JSON** for data integration.

## üöÄ How It Works

The application provides a streamlined workflow for comprehensive contract review:

1.  **Configure**: Set up your API keys in the `.env.local` file.
2.  **Upload or Paste**: Upload a contract document or paste the text directly into the editor.
3.  **Select Provider**: Choose your preferred AI provider (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.) from the dropdown menu.
4.  **Analyze**: Click "Analyze Contract" to start the process. The system splits the document into clauses and sends each one for deep analysis.
5.  **Review in Real-Time**: Watch as the results populate the dashboard, clause by clause.
6.  **Explore the Report**:
    -   Click through the **Clause List** to see detailed analysis for each section.
    -   Switch to the **Negotiation Checklist** tab for a high-level overview of action items.
    -   Check the **Missing Clauses Report** to identify structural gaps in the contract.
7.  **Download**: Export the full report for offline use.
